# Investment Outlook: Luxury Real Estate vs. Stocks in 2026

Volatility haunts stocks, but luxury RE yields steady 11% returns. Azure Estate's 2026 forecast favors tangibles.

## Comparative Edge
| Asset | Avg. Return | Liquidity | Tangibility |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Stocks | 7-9% | High | Low |
| Luxury RE | 10-12% | Medium | High |

Hedge with $10M+ diversifiers like our $16M Miami portfolio.
